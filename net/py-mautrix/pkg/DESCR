A Python 3.6+ asyncio Matrix framework.

Components:

* Basic HTTP request sender (mautrix.api)
* Client API endpoints as functions (mautrix.client.api)
* Medium-level application service framework (mautrix.appservice)
* Basic transaction and user/alias query support (based on Cadair's python-appservice-framework)
* Basic room state storage
* Intent wrapper around the client API functions (design based on matrix-appservice-bridge)
* Soon(TM): High-level bridging framework (mautrix.bridge).
* High-level client framework (mautrix.client). Currently only has an event handling helper.
